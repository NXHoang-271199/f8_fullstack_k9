        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is a precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q> ultra-low-temperature poaching </q>.</p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Sal</p>
        <p>Next month, we wil be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30</p>
